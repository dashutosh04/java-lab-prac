 * Define an interface with three methods – earnings(), deductions() and bonus() and
 * define a Java class ‘Manager’ which uses this interface without implementing bonus() method.
 *  Also define another Java class ‘Substaff’ which extends from ‘Manager’ class and implements bonus() method.  
 * Write the complete program to find out earnings, deduction and 
 * bonus of a substaff with basic salary amount entered by the user as per the following guidelines –
 * earnings           basic + DA (80% of basic) + HRA (15% of basic)
 * deduction PF       12% of basic
 * bonus             50% of basic
